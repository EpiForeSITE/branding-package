# Notes from Andrew's Playground

`_brand.yml` is only supported in Quarto v1.6.X and higher. (I discovered this because I was using v1.5.X).

`brand.yml` is only supported in the following Quarto formats: `html`, `dashboard`, `revealjs`, and `typst` ([source](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html))
