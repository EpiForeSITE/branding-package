You can set `brand` features for specific pages that differ from the global features defined in `_brand.yml`. In this case, we've changed the primary color to ForeSITE Red, updating the navigation bar.

Note, however, that when you provide page-specific `brand` values the given page ignores most other values defined in `_brand.yml`, even the `_brand.yml` values not specified. Thus, by setting a new primary color for this page (and just a new primary color), we've lost our fonts and colors (which reverted to Quarto defaults), but retained our logo.
